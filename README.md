# mob splitting
This is a proof of concept datapack that splits mobs up into two smaller versions upon their deaths.
This is done using the new `minecraft:generic.scale` attribute introduced in 23w51a.

Splitting also reduces the maximum number of hearts and explosion size of the split entities.
Currently only creepers and spiders split upon death, but this is easily configured through the
`fisch37:splits_on_death` tag.

I'm not sure if I'll do anything further with this pack, but feel free to use whatever you want.
